  abstract = {Intraindividual change over time is commonly used to estimate treatment effectiveness. However, patients may not respond similarly to a scale after treatment, rendering pre–post change an unreliable metric. The current objective was to investigate longitudinal measurement invariance of the Patient Health Questionnaire–9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale–7 among 4,323 patients completing a partial hospital program. We used confirmatory factor analysis to determine (1) factor structure at pretreatment and posttreatment and (2) longitudinal invariance, accounting for dependent observations, using both classical and approximate measurement invariance approaches. Results indicated a two-factor solution for both scales. Longitudinal invariance was not established for either scale, thus, using raw score differences from the Patient Health Questionnaire–9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale–7 for measuring symptom change over time may be problematic. The most longitudinally consistent items captured somatic as opposed to affective/cognitive symptoms. We discuss the potential use of these measures for diagnostic screening and between-group comparisons and suggest alternative ways to monitor client progress over time. Limitations included a majority White sample and uniqueness of a partial hospital setting.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the seven-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) are routinely used in research and clinical practice. Whilst measurement invariance of these measures across gender has been demonstrated individually in general population studies and clinical samples, less is known about invariance of the distinct but correlated latent factors (‘depression’ and ‘anxiety’). The current study assessed measurement invariance of these constructs across males and females seeking treatment for common mental health disorders.                                         Methods               Data were provided from eight psychological treatment services in London, England. Data from initial assessments with the services where individual items on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were available were included in analyses. Measurement invariance was explored across self-identified genders, with ‘male’ and ‘female’ categories available in the dataset. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using propensity score matching on sociodemographic and clinical variables.                                         Results               Data were available for 165,872 patients (110,833 females, 55,039 males). There was evidence of measurement invariance between males and females in both the full sample and a propensity score matched sample (n\,=\,46,249 in each group).                                         Conclusions               Measurement invariance of the correlated depression and anxiety factors of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were indicated in this sample of individuals seeking psychological treatment for CMHDs. These results support the use of these measures in routine clinical practice for both males and females. This is of particular importance for assessing the prevalence of clinically significant levels of symptoms as well as comparing treatment outcomes across genders.},
